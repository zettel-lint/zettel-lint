# Zettel Linter

Is this actually a suite of tools?

Uses [commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) for CLI parsing

* Linker:
  * Backlinks tracker (references.md)
  * Wikilink updater
  * 3rd party integrations
  * Optionally create new pages on the fly
* Task tracker/GTD/#BuJo:
  * repeating tasks
  * snoozed tasks
  * move tasks between wiki & todo.txt
  * goal tracker
* Note management:
  * meta notes (TODO, DONE, tags)
  * templates

## Alternatives

* (✔) Look at useful VS Code extensions
  * MZettel
  * todotxt mode
  * [Markdown Links to graph connections](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tchayen.markdown-links)
  * [Markdown Lint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint#configure)
  * [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
* (✔) See [FOAM](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) for VS Code-based solution

## `zl *` Tasks

* x 2025-05-13 (C) Should take seconds to run, at most, on 10000 file example repo
* x 2025-05-13 (E) Add tests for regex

## `zl graph` Tasks

* (E) Task tracker - tasks completed per day
* (Y) Export link as [a flowchart](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/flowchart) - see also Name: [Markdown Links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tchayen.markdown-links) - this may be easier under indexer?

## `zl kanban` Tasks

* (F) Kanban view for Trello-imported notes, one md per board, with tables

## `zl index` Tasks

* x 2021-07-01 (A) Use better regex for filter parsing, to support complex internal regex
* x 2025-06-10 (B) Grep for orphaned + links across all files (including .txt)
* x 2021-07-01 (B) link checker should support wiki-link syntax
* (B) Task list should include `*.txt` except `done*.txt` (or configurable exclude glob for non-English users)
* x 2021-07-01 (C) Show tags in top section next to links and backlinks
* (D) "Soft references" that match filename should show below backlinks - needs to be fast
* (F) Highlight orphaned links and offer to create page 
* (G) Task sort options: ~~By Project (i.e. filename, or by + annotations)~~, ~~by due date~~, ~~by start date~~, ~~by priority~~, ~~alphabetically~~, by context (@ symbols), by List (if multiple `## Tasks` per file)
* (G) Format Trello boards as Tables of Content, not 2D tables? 
* (H) Sort all tasks by priority then due date (cli options for this?) - letters, then checkbox then others 
* x 2021-07-01 (H) Use first # Title or title: as the title in `zl index` 
* (H) Create indexer for notes with a list: header for blogging/Trello imports. 
* x 2021-07-01 (I) Option to generate separate index, tag, orphan, etc. files - each type has a file arg, but all can use references.md for current behaviour
* (L) Add anchored links from pages with tags to a collection page, and generate tag meta pages alongside references.md `tag-blog.md` for example (can then use these instead of a separate tag section in references?)

## `zl notes` Tasks

* (C) *-Daily files should have a title like YYYY-MM-DD
* (C) Allow prefix links (e.g. only link to day, not day time) if the prefix is unambiguous

* (E) Expand prefix links (e.g. only link to day, not day time) to canonical form if the prefix is unambiguous
* (E) Turn [Titles] links into [[xxxxxxxxxxxxx]] links
* (E) Extend classes to support notes
* (H) Output links to `## Links` section at bottom of each note : only needed if not using wiki-links

* (L) Support pages in a hierarchy, but allow page links to only reference leaf text (use namespacing rules)
* (P) Automatically generate bidirectional links when saving/committing markdown files

## `zl cron` Tasks
